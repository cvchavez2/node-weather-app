Template Engine (share templates across html files)

we will use Handle bars (npm i hbs (we use hbs instead of handlebars since hbs is the express view engine))

allow us to render dynamic docs
easily create code that we can reuse across pages


Nodemon args

if you want nodemon to listen to changes on other files
nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs
