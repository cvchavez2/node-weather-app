install heroku cli tools using homebrew

- heroku -v
- heroku login
- heroku keys:add
if a key is found then add it -y

- heroku create "provide a unique app name"
two links are displayed, one is for your app and the other 
is the heroku repository link where you should be pushing your code

we have to tell heroku how to start our app 
that gets done in the package.json

we add a script {
  "start": "node src/app.js"
}

we can use npm run start to run that same script

next change we have to do goes on the app.js file
we need to change the port number since we have a fixed one
create a const called port:
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000

when the app is running in heroku it will know which port to allocate using the process.env.PORT variable
replace the fixed port below with the new const
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log('server is running on port: ' + port);
})

change also the public/app.js file fetch call since it is targeting localhost:3000
  fetch('/weather?address=' + encodeURIComponent(location)).then((response) => {
